## About Me (She/Her) 👩🏻‍💻

Hello world! I currently work as an iOS developer. However, I have been dipping my toes into front-end developement and quantum computing. Both have been very enjoyable! My skillset is strong in Swift, Python, C, Java and Go! 

My dream job would be somewhere where there was space that allowed me to be creative and supported my growth. Bonus points if my work contributes to making a difference in the world. Even more bonus points if they (really do) care about diversity and the environment!

  ### Even more curious? Cool. 
  
  I was born and raised in Austin, Tx - except for two short stints in Mexico and San Antonio. Long story for another time. 
  
  I love reading, but I especially love poetry and topics on astronmy, physics and philosophy. My goal is to have my own library in the future. 
  
  I love film. My fave film makers are Greta Gerwig, Richard Linklater (before trilogy), Alejandro Jodrowsky, Jean Luc Godard, Wes Anderson and Tarantino. 
  
  I sprinkle those interests with pc gaming (Overwatch, Resident Evil and Little Nightmares are some faves), skateboarding and painting. 
  
  ### My story on how I got into programming: :keyboard:
  
 * Back in 2016, I was just a student studying biochem and hating every minute. Don't get me wrong, though. I love learning, but it was pretty rough sitting in those classes. I had really enjoyed chemistry and biology in high school, but I lost that enthusiasm in college. It could have been the instructors, or even just personal things happening in my life. Regardless, I wanted to switch majors, but had no clue as to what I wanted to do with my life.
  
 * It wasn't until one fateful night during summer, that while googling 'Monty Python memes' - I discoverd my calling finally. I came across the link to [Python (Programming Language)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)). When I saw that, I thought * What the heck is a programming language? How does this relate to Monty Python?...* With those questions in mind and my curious nature, I clicked on the link. 
  
  **Little fun fact:** *Python is actually named after Monty Python. Another reason why Python is so great.* :snake:
 
 * When I looked at the link, nothing really made sense at first. So as it goes on the internet, I went down the rabbit hole of information trying to understand what the heck I came across. Finding out you could actually communicate with a computer was just an insane concept to me. I had to learn more. I did learn more. I then took on "Learn Python the Hard Way" and did so much coding over the summer. It was the most fun that I had had in awhile. It inspired me to try a class in programming the following semester. 
  
  * I took programming I, and found that it was the most enjoyable class I had taken thus far in my college career. I had to keep learning more. Soon after finishing the class, I swtiched my major to computer science. My favorite classes were all of my programming classes. Everything else paled in comparison, and honestly, it was the classes I did the best in. 
  
 * Funny how life can develop by serendipitous discoveries. I genuinely believe that programming and engineering is modern day magic. Every line of code is a line in an incantation. Every variable is an ingredient in a spell; so that you can bring into existence something that wasn't there before. You can literally create anything with it and apply it to any field. Even art.
 
  * Yeah. Programming is pretty damn cool, and I am glad Monty Python brought us together. 
  
  ### Ni!

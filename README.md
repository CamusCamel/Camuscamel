# About Me :blue_heart:  

Hello world! I currently work as an iOS developer. However, I have been dipping my toes into front-end developement and quantum computing. Both have been very enjoyable! Specialty is in Swift, Python, C, Java and Go!

  Even more curious? Ok. 
  
  I was born and raised in Austin, Tx - except for two short stints in Mexico and San Antonio. Long story for another time. 
  
  I love reading, but I especially love poetry and topics on astronmy, physics and philosophy. My goal is to have my own library in the future. 
  
  I love film. My fave film makers are Greta Gerwig, Richard Linklater (before trilogy), Alejandro Jodrowsky, Jean Luc Godard, Wes Anderson and Tarantino. 
  
  I sprinkle those interests with pc gaming (Overwatch, Resident Evil and Little Nightmares are some faves), skateboarding and painting. 
  
  **My story on how I got into programming:** 
  
 * Back in 2016, I was just a student studying biochem and hating every minute. Don't get me wrong, though. I love learning, but it was pretty rough sitting in those classes. I had really enjoyed chemistry and biology in high school, but I lost that enthusiasm in college. It could have been the instructors, or even just personal things happening in my life. Regardless, I wanted to switch majors, but had no clue as to what I wanted to do with my life.
  
 * It wasn't until one fateful night during summer, that while googling 'Monty Python memes' - I discoverd my calling finally. I came across the link to [Python (Programming Language)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)). When I saw that, I thought * What the heck is a programming language? How does this relate to Monty Python?...* With those questions in mind and my curious nature, I clicked on the link. 
  
  **Little fun fact:** Python is actually named after Monty Python. Another reason why Python is so great.
 
 * When I looked at the link, nothing really made sense at first. So as it goes on the internet, I went down the rabbit hole of information trying to understand what the heck I came across. Finding out you could actually communicate with a computer was just an insane concept to me. I had to learn more. I did learn more. I then took on "Learn Python the Hard Way" and did so much coding over the summer. It was the most fun that I had had in awhile. It inspired me to try a class in programming the following semester. 
  
  * I took programming I, and found that it was the most enjoyable class I had taken thus far in my college career. I had to keep learning more. Soon after finishing the class, I swtiched my major to computer science. My favorite classes were all of my programming classes. Everything else paled in comparison, and honestly, it was the classes I did the best in. 
  
 * Funny how life can develop by serendipitous discoveries. I genuinely believe that programming and engineering is modern day magic. Every line of code is a line in an incantation. Every variable is an ingredient in a spell; so that you can bring into existence something that wasn't there before. You can literally create anything with it and apply it to any field. Even art.
 
  * Yeah. Programming is pretty damn cool, and I am glad Monty Python brought us together. 
  
  **Ni!**

## About Me (She/Her) 👩🏻‍💻

   **Hello world!** I currently work as an iOS developer and have done so for about a year now. I graduated in May 2019 with a degree in computer science and a concentration in cloud computing. My skillset is strong in Swift, Python, C, Java and the occasional Go! However, I have been dipping my toes into front-end developement and quantum computing as of lately. 
   
   I am very aesthetic-orientated, so front-end really allows me to tap into that side of me. I have been focusing on HTML, CSS, Javascript and React. It has been a lot of fun! As for quantum computing, it combines my interests of phyiscs and computer science. 
   
   It is such a new field with so many discoveries to be made that I can't help wanting to join in on the party. Not to mention, I love that the majority of programming in the quantum field uses Python(my first programming language) and also, they just have an awesome community around it. Looking at you, Qiskit. 
   
   I have so many interests. We will have to see what life has in store for me. Can't wait to see!

  ### Even more curious? Cool. 
  
  * I was born and raised in Austin, Tx - except for two short stints in Mexico and San Antonio. Long story for another time. 
  
  * I love reading, but I especially love poetry and topics on astronmy, physics and philosophy. My goal is to have my own library in the future. 
  
  * I love film. My fave film makers are Greta Gerwig, Richard Linklater (before trilogy), Alejandro Jodrowsky, Jean Luc Godard, Wes Anderson and Tarantino. 
  
  * I sprinkle those interests with pc gaming (Overwatch, Resident Evil and Little Nightmares are some faves), skateboarding and painting. 
  
  * Koreaboo first, weaboo second. 
  
  ### My story on how I got into programming: :keyboard:
  
 * Back in 2016, I was just a student studying biochem and hating every minute. Don't get me wrong, though. I love learning, but it was pretty rough sitting in those classes. I had really enjoyed chemistry and biology in high school, but I lost that enthusiasm in college. It could have been the instructors, or even just personal things happening in my life. Regardless, I wanted to switch majors, but had no clue as to what I wanted to do with my life.
  
 * It wasn't until one fateful night during summer, that while googling 'Monty Python memes' - I discoverd my calling finally. I came across the link to [Python (Programming Language)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)). When I saw that, I thought *What the heck is a programming language? How does this relate to Monty Python?...* With those questions in mind and my curious nature, I clicked on the link. 
  
  **Little fun fact:** *Python is actually named after Monty Python. Another reason why Python is so great.* :snake:
 
 * When I looked at the link, nothing really made sense at first. So as it goes on the internet, I went down the rabbit hole of information trying to understand what the heck I came across. Finding out you could actually communicate with a computer was just an insane concept to me. I had to learn more. I did learn more. I then took on "Learn Python the Hard Way" and did so much coding over the summer. It was the most fun that I had had in awhile. It inspired me to try a class in programming the following semester. 
  
  * I took programming I, and found that it was the most enjoyable class I had taken thus far in my college career. I had to keep learning more. Soon after finishing the class, I swtiched my major to computer science. My favorite classes were all of my programming classes. Everything else paled in comparison, and honestly, it was the classes I did the best in. 
  
 * Funny how life can develop by serendipitous discoveries. I genuinely believe that programming and engineering is modern day magic. Every line of code is a line in an incantation. Every variable is an ingredient in a spell; so that you can bring into existence something that wasn't there before. You can literally create anything with it and apply it to any field. Even art.
 
  * Yeah. Programming is pretty damn cool, and I am glad Monty Python brought us together.
